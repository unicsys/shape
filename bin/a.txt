Slide 2 – Problem Statement

DoD mission effectiveness depends on responsiveness, not efficiency.

Current supply chain structure is tiered, opaque, and slow.

Critical manufacturing (chips, batteries, pharma) is offshore.

Lack of visibility into MSMM (Micro, Small, Mid-size Manufacturers) capabilities → limits surge response.

Slide 3 – Technical Gap

Capacity visibility: proprietary & confidential.

Capability visibility: no standard way to define & share.

Ontologies today: static, hard to update at speed.

Result: OEM-driven, siloed supply chains → no agility.

Slide 4 – Proposed Approach

Supply Network Ontology + Knowledge Graph

Standardized vocabulary for manufacturing processes, machines, sectors.

Linked graph of suppliers & capabilities.

LLM-driven Ontology Integration

Convert unstructured supplier capability data → ontology-aligned entries.

Auto-formalize queries into machine-actionable logic.

Neuro-Symbolic Methods

LLMs generate → formal reasoning tools validate (constraint solving, model checking).

Ensures consistency + removes hallucinations.

Slide 5 – Technical Workstreams

Ontology & Knowledge Graph Layer

Manufacturing Ontology (processes: additive, subtractive, robotics, biotech, defense).

Graph DB with supplier capability nodes.

LLM Integration Layer

LLM trained on manufacturing + defense sectors.

Auto-formalization pipeline:

Query → LLM → refinement → formal methods → formalized query.

Capability Database

Large-scale MSMM capability ingestion (100K+ suppliers).

Continuous updates via LLM extraction & mapping.

Validation Use Cases

Drone manufacturing, battery production.

Lot size of one and lot size of many.

Slide 6 – Current Progress

Built 100K+ supplier capability database.

Trained AI models to identify cross-sector manufacturing patterns.

Developed methods to map replaceable manufacturing steps → alternate suppliers.

Demonstrated rapid manufacturing path generation for surge response.

Slide 7 – Impact for DoD & Enterprise

Agility: rapid pivot to lot-size-one or mass production.

Resilience: reduces dependency on foreign suppliers.

Scalability: AI-driven expansion of supplier base.

Cost efficiency: alternative to expensive TCA/DCA contracts.

Slide 8 – Next Steps / Proposal

Formalize ontology–LLM integration pipeline.

Build company-internal pilot:

Capability ingestion + knowledge graph + LLM query layer.

Validate on two use cases (drones & batteries).

Scale to broader defense manufacturing applications.
