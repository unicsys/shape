To become a recognized industry leader and senior executive (e.g., Chief Engineer, Technical Fellow, or Director) driving the strategy and implementation of AI-driven digital engineering ecosystems. I aspire to shape the future of how complex aerospace and defense systems are designed, built, and sustained through the application of formal methods and intelligent systems.

Roles I Want to Learn:

    Enterprise Architect: To gain a broader perspective on how different business units and functions can be integrated through a unified digital and AI strategy.


Enterprise-wide adoption of a unified digital thread, underpinned by formal ontologies and knowledge graphs.

Development and deployment of a new generation of generative AI agents that automate and optimize critical engineering workflows across the product lifecycle.

=========

goal short term
 Solidify my role as a key technical leader in AI and semantics within my current organization.

    Action 1: Successfully lead the design and implementation of the enterprise-level formal ontology, ensuring its adoption by at least two major programs or business units.

    Action 2: Publish at least one internal white paper or present at an RTX technical symposium on the practical application of generative AI and knowledge graphs in our domain.




goal long term
Transition into a role with enterprise-level strategic impact, such as a Principal Engineer with broader scope, an Enterprise Architect, or a Technical Fellow.

    Action 1: Build a strong professional network across RTX by collaborating on cross-functional projects and initiatives.

    Action 2: Develop and present a strategic proposal for a new AI-driven capability that addresses a key business challenge for the company.

    Action 3: Take a leading role in an external industry consortium or standards body related to digital engineering or AI in aerospace and defense.

Long-Term Goal 2: Become a recognized thought leader in the application of AI and formal methods in aerospace and defense.

    Action 1: Publish research in a top-tier journal or present at a major international conference (e.g., AIAA, INCOSE, or a leading AI conference).
